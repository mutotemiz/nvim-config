This is a repository for personal use, so no guarantee that it will work on your system. But feel free to try and modify.

## Prerequisites:
* `neovim` 0.11+
* A python virtual environment set at the location: `~/.local/share/nvim/venv/neovim`
* `pynvm` package is installed into the virtual environment mentioned above.
* `tree-sitter-cli` (v0.25+) is installed. (In Debian 13, the version is 0.22, therefore you need to install it in a different way. I used installing via `cargo`. But that was also old in Debian, so I installed tat from Debian backports first.)
* FOR DEBIAN-13: `cargo` (v1.88+) is installed on the system and `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is added to the `$PATH`.
